## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Wyr is a simple language that translates *.wyr files into NASM code. It's a hobby project and is for me to learn NASM, so if any issues arise please create an issue with details. 

Why Wyr?
- Wyr is simple
- Wyr is clean
- Wyr *usually* works

Why NOT Wyr?
- Wyr is currently not finished, and only implements really basic functionality
- Wyr doesn't use a proper lexer for token gen

## Built With

This project uses pure V lang

* [V lang](https://vlang.io/)

## Getting Started

Getting started with wyr is easy.

### Prerequisites

First you'll need to install vlang itself

* vlang

```sh
wget https://github.com/vlang/v/releases/latest/download/v_linux.zip
unzip v_linux.zip
cd v
sudo ./v symlink
```

* NASM & LD
```sh
sudo apt install nasm ld
```

### Installation

To install wyr, just clone the repo. From there you can try an example
```sh
git clone git@github.com:HUSKI3/Wyr.git
cd Wyr
./build.sh examples/name.wyr
```
